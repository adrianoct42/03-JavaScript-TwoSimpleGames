# 03-JavaScript_-_2_Simple_Games
My personal studies of JS based on Jonas Schmedtmann course in Udemy. :)

To start any of those games, just open the "index.html" file in your preferred browser.


-- FIRST GAME: GUESS MY NUMBER

You'll have to guess a number between 1 and 30.
You start with 30 points, for every mistake, you get a tip and also lose a point.
Go for the best score!


-- SECOND GAME: PIG GAME - A 2 player experience.

The game starts with Player 1 as a starter.
The player has the option to either ROLL A DICE or HOLD.
If you choose ROLL, you will roll a 6-sided dice, and if it results in 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6
it's value will be added to your CURRENT score. You can roll again if you wish.
The HOLD button will add your CURRENT score to your TOTAL score, and then it will be the other player's turn.
However, if you rolled a "1", you will lose all your CURRENT score and pass the turn to Player 2.
Objective: The first player to score 64 points, wins!
You can push the NEW GAME button to restart everything.
